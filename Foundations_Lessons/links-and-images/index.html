        <h1>Homepage</h1>

        To create a link in HTML, we use the "Anchor" element. Inside the opening tag of the anchor,
        we need to use the "href" (HTML Reference) attribute to tell give our anchor tag a destination.
        Any anchor without an href attribute will be plaintext; once the href is added, it becomes a
        blue hyperlink. You can use href to link to other HTML documents, PDF's, images, videos, etc. 
        Here is an example of a link:
        <p><a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about">Click Me!</a></p>
        
        <h1>Absolute and Relative Links:</h1>
        Links to pages on other websites are called <em>"Absolute Links."</em> An absolute link will
        typically look like this: <strong>protocol://domain/path</strong>. The link above is an absolute
        link, as it points to The Odin Project's About page.

        <p><em>Relative Links</em> are links that point to pages within our own website. Since a Relative
        Link is contained within our own project, it assumes that the protocol is the same as the page we
        created the link on. Relative links only contain the file path to the other page <em>relative</em>
        to the page it is linked from. Here is an example of a Relative Link:</p>

        <a href="./pages/about.html">About</a>

        <p>Note: Normally we just want our index.html file in the root of our project folder, and we want
            our other pages to be in a seperate directory. To make sure that our relative link is robust,
            we will want to prepend our relative path with "./". In this case, we use the href attribute:
            <p><strong>href="./pages/about.html"</strong></p>
        </p>

        <h1>Images</h1>

        To display an image in HTML we use the <img> element. Unlike other elements, the <img> tag is empty,
        which means that it doesn't have a closing tag. Instead of wrapping content in an opening and closing
        tag, it embeds an image into the page using an src attribute which tells the browser where the image is.
        The <img> element works much like the href attribute for anchor tags; it can embed an image using both
        absolute and relative paths.

        <p>For example: using an absolute path we can display an image located on The Odin Project Website:</p>

        <img
        src="https://www.theodinproject.com/mstile-310x310.png" alt="The Odin Project logo">

        <p> Relative path images are assumed to be in the same path as the rest of your webpage. Here is an 
            example of an image with a relative path (meaning the image resides in the directory of this webpage):
            <p>
                <img
                    src="./images/TOP_dog.jpg" alt="An image of some TOP member's dog">
            </p>
        </p>

        <p> Besides the src attribute, each image should have an <strong>alt</strong>, or and <em>alternative
            text</em> attribute. The alt attribute is used to describe an image, and will be used in place of 
            the image if it cannot be loaded. It is also used by screen readers to describe the image for the 
            visually impaired.
        </p>

        Finally, this is a link to the top of the page. You have to make sure to place an anchor at the top of 
        the page, which we will link to from below:

        <p>
            <a href="#top">Back to top of page</a>
        </p>

    </body>
