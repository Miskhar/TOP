        To create a link in HTML, we use the "Anchor" element. Inside the opening tag of the anchor,
        we need to use the "href" (HTML Reference) attribute to tell give our anchor tag a destination.
        Any anchor without an href attribute will be plaintext; once the href is added, it becomes a
        blue hyperlink. You can use href to link to other HTML documents, PDF's, images, videos, etc. 
        Here is an example of a link:
        <p><a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about">Click Me!</a></p>
        
        <h1>Absolute and Relative Links:</h1>
        Links to pages on other websites are called <em>"Absolute Links."</em> An absolute link will
        typically look like this: <strong>protocol://domain/path</strong>. The link above is an absolute
        link, as it points to The Odin Project's About page.

        <p><em>Relative Links</em> are links that point to pages within our own website. Since a Relative
        Link is contained within our own project, it assumes that the protocol is the same as the page we
        created the link on. Relative links only contain the file path to the other page <em>relative</em>
        to the page it is linked from. Here is an example of a Relative Link:</p>

        <a href="./pages/about.html">About</a>

        <p>Note: Normally we just want our index.html file in the root of our project folder, and we want
            our other pages to be in a seperate directory. To make sure that our relative link is robust,
            we will want to prepend our relative path with "./". In this case, we use the href attribute:
            <p><strong>href="./pages/about.html"</strong>></p>
        </p>
    </body>
